# Understanding ConfigMaps, DaemonSets, Kubernetes Services, Secrets & Persistent Volume Claims
This repository was created as part of IBM's "Introduction to Containers, Kubernetes and OpenShift" course.<br>
It's a practice project about Kubernetes using Docker.<br>
Much of the code was cloned from the IBM repository: https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/containers-project.git<br>
<br>
<br>

## What I have done as part of the project
As a lot of the work was done in the terminal, it is not visible in the repository.<br>
I therefore explain my completed tasks in the project.<br>

## Getting Started
The code was only executable with the help of the IBM Cloud IDE.<br>
The IDE had many necessary tools and accesses preconfigured. These include, for example, Kubernetes installation or IBM Cloud Container Registry.
