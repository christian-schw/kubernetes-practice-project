# Understanding ConfigMaps, DaemonSets, Kubernetes Services, Secrets & Persistent Volume Claims
This repository was created as part of IBM's "Introduction to Containers, Kubernetes and OpenShift" course.<br>
It's a practice project about Kubernetes using Docker.<br>
Much of the code was cloned from the IBM repository: https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/containers-project.git<br>

## What I have done as part of the project
As a lot of the work was done in the terminal, it is not visible in the repository.<br>
I therefore explain my completed tasks in the project below.<br>
<br>

### Build and deploy the application to Kubernetes
Setup of the environment variable namespace (user name is already predefined in IBM Cloud IDE):<br>

![setup env var](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1614d19f-eb82-478a-8e7a-6a246604ca75)

The image was then built using the Dockerfile.<br>

```
docker build . -t us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/myapp:v1
```

The -t flag was used to set the name and tag of the image according to the IBM course naming convention.<br>
Result:<br>

![docker images](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71d10198-9fa1-4c18-9242-115451391641)

After the image has been built, it is pushed into the IBM Container Registry:<br>

```
docker push us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/myapp:v1 
```

Result:<br>

![ibmcloud cr images](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c94e442-be79-4afc-b067-055765dcbf40)

The K8s object deployment is then created.<br>
Here the placeholder of the namespace must be replaced with my namespace:<br>

![deployment yml](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24280b7f-1651-4ace-a9d4-6d593c600d2d)

Apply the deployment:<br>

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
```

Verification of the deployment:<br>

![kubectl pods deployment yml](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a6c8bfb-be3b-45dc-acd3-1d2c51fb85da)

Now start application on port-forward:<br>

```
kubectl port-forward deployment.apps/myapp 3000:3000 
```

Port forwarding in Kubernetes is a mechanism that allows you to access services running within a Kubernetes cluster from your local machine or another external system.<br>
It's useful for debugging, testing, and accessing services during development.<br>
<br>
Output of application:<br>

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
<br>
<br>

### Set up a ConfigMap
To decouple environment-specific configuration from the container image, so that the application is easily portable.<br>
According to the task, literals are to be used in the practical project.<br>
These are defined with the flag '--from-literal'.<br>
This makes it possible to create a ConfigMap via CLI.<br>
<br>
Two environment variables should be created:<br>
- Key: server-url, Value: http://example.com
- Key: timeout, Value: 5000
<br>
This results in the following command:<br>

```
kubectl create configmap myapp-config --from-literal=server-url=http://example.com --from-literal=timeout=5000
```

Verification of the ConfigMap:<br>

![verification configmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8aea7b7-a236-4950-bcc2-5efb95923cf4)

Data = 2, which means that two environment variables have been created. Everything fits.<br>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
<br>
<br>

### Create a DaemonSet
DaemonSet is used to ensure that a pod runs on each node in the cluster, including the nodes where the application pods are deployed.<br>
Result: Enhanced availability and fault tolerance of the application through redundancy and load distribution.<br>
<br>
First, the daemonset.yaml file is adjusted.<br>
Here the placeholder of the namespace must be replaced with my namespace:<br>

![adjust daemonset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/274b76c2-f9dd-46af-a97f-1714595381a8)

Next, the daemonset.yaml file is applied:<br>

```
kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml
```

Verification of the DaemonSet:<br>

![verification daemonset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6145f823-170f-4ada-ac81-78e844988d7e)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
<br>
<br>

### Expose application within the cluster
K8s services are used to expose the application within the cluster.<br>
In this case: NodePort Service.<br>
NodePort exposes service on a port on all nodes in the cluster.<br>
<br>
First, service.yaml is applied:<br>

```
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

Verification of the service:<br>

![verification service](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86cc05a1-2b0f-4397-8158-7e42167df1d6)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
<br>
<br>

### Create and manage secrets
K8s Secrets are used to securely store sensitive information (such as passwords, tokens and SSH keys).<br>
As with ConfigMap, literals are used in the practice project to create Secrets.<br>
<br>
Two environment variables should be created:<br>
- Key: username, Value: myuser
- Key: password, Value: mysecretpassword
<br>
This results in the following command:<br>

```
kubectl create secret generic myapp-secret --from-literal=username=myuser --from-literal=password=mysecretpassword
```

Verification of the Secret:<br>

![verification secret](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9422c5e9-0c4c-4ffb-a22b-88643daf7223)

Again: Data = 2, which means that two environment variables have been created. Everything fits.<br>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
<br>
<br>

### Provide storage for application
To provide storage for the application, two K8s objects are used:
- PersistentVolume (PV): Storage resource provisioned by an administrator in the cluster that exists independently of any Pod that might use it.
- PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC): Request for storage by a user or a Pod which consumes PersistentVolumes. PVCs provide a way for users to request the storage resources they need.
<br>
The definitions of the two objects can be found in the file volume-and-pvc.yaml.<br>
Both definitions are separated from each other by three dashes (---).<br>
<br>
PersistentVolume provides 1 gigabyte of storage and the PVC requests this 1 gigabyte of storage.<br>

## Getting Started
The code was only executable with the help of the IBM Cloud IDE.<br>
The IDE had many necessary tools and accesses preconfigured. These include, for example, Kubernetes installation or IBM Cloud Container Registry.
